# Reddit Comment Harvester

Small Python utility for pulling Reddit threads (posts + comment trees) into structured Python objects or flat CSV for analysis.

Built for research workflows where you already have thread URLs and want repeatable exports of post metadata (title, subreddit, score) and comment data (authors, bodies, scores).

**Quick disclaimer:** You're responsible for complying with Reddit's Terms of Service and rate limits. This tool adds optional randomized delays to reduce request bursts.

## Why This Exists

Many tools rely on Reddit's API (like PRAW), which requires authentication and limits access. This tool fetches public `.json` endpoints directly from Reddit, so you can:

- Extract threads without API registration
- Get full comment trees with metadata (authors, scores, timestamps)
- Export to CSV for analysis
- Access raw JSON for custom processing
- Add optional randomized delays to reduce request bursts

**What it doesn't do:** vote, post, access private/restricted communities, or authenticate with Reddit.

**How it works:** Appends `.json` to Reddit thread/comment URLs and parses the returned JSON (no API keys required).

## About

Reddit Comment Harvester is a lightweight Python package for research workflows involving Reddit discussions. It extracts thread and comment data from Reddit's public `.json` endpoints, without requiring API authentication.

**Data captured:**
- Thread: title, author, score, subreddit, post date, comment count
- Comments: author, body text, score, depth in tree, comment date

**Limitations:** Comments with deleted/removed bodies appear with empty text fields. Comment nesting depth is preserved but trees are flattened in CSV export.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install reddit-comment-harvester
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlyastn/reddit-comment-harvester.git
cd reddit-comment-harvester
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

```python
from reddit_comment_harvester import RedditScraper

scraper = RedditScraper()
thread = scraper.scrape("https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/")

print(f"Title: {thread.title}")
print(f"Subreddit: {thread.subreddit}")
print(f"Score: {thread.score}")
print(f"Comments: {len(thread.comments)}")
```

## Usage

### Extract a Single Thread

```python
from reddit_comment_harvester import RedditScraper

scraper = RedditScraper()
thread = scraper.scrape("https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/")
```

### Batch Process Multiple URLs

```python
from reddit_comment_harvester import RedditScraper

scraper = RedditScraper()

urls = [
    "https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/",
    "https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/def456/",
    "https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/ghi789/",
]

threads = scraper.scrape_batch(urls)
print(f"Scraped {len(threads)} threads")
```

### Process URLs from CSV

```python
from reddit_comment_harvester import RedditScraper

scraper = RedditScraper()

results = scraper.scrape_csv(
    input_file="urls.csv",
    output_file="results.csv",
    url_column="URL"
)

print(f"Saved {len(results)} results to results.csv")
```

### Get Raw JSON Response

For advanced use cases, you can retrieve the raw JSON response from Reddit:

```python
from reddit_comment_harvester import RedditScraper
import json

scraper = RedditScraper()

# Get raw JSON instead of parsed Thread object
raw_json = scraper.scrape("https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/", return_raw=True)

# Save to file for custom processing
with open("reddit_data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(raw_json, f, indent=2)

# Or process directly
post_data = raw_json[0]["data"]["children"][0]["data"]
comments_data = raw_json[1]["data"]
```

**Why use raw JSON?**
- Custom data processing and analysis
- Access all Reddit API fields (not just parsed subset)
- Full comment tree with all nesting levels
- Flexibility for research workflows

## Example Output

### Thread Object

After scraping a thread, you get a `Thread` object:

```python
thread.title
# "Why Python is the best language for beginners"

thread.author
# "john_coder"

thread.subreddit
# "python"

thread.score
# 2847

thread.num_comments
# 156

thread.comments[0]
# Comment(
#   author='jane_dev',
#   body='Great explanation! Especially liked the...',
#   score=245,
#   depth=0
# )
```

### CSV Export

When exported to CSV, each row represents one comment (the post metadata repeats for each comment):

```csv
url,title,subreddit,post_id,author,post_score,num_comments,comment_author,comment_body,comment_score,comment_depth
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/,Why Python is best...,python,abc123,john_coder,2847,156,jane_dev,"Great explanation! Especially liked...",245,0
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/,Why Python is best...,python,abc123,john_coder,2847,156,mike_learn,"I disagree with point 2 because...",89,1
```

**Note:** Each comment creates a new row with the full post metadata. For large threads, this results in many rows. Consider filtering or grouping if needed.

## Configuration

Optional parameters for scraper behavior:

```python
scraper = RedditScraper(
    timeout=60.0,           # Request timeout in seconds (default: 60.0)
    delay=True,             # Add random delays between requests (default: True)
    proxies=None            # Optional proxy config (default: None)
)
```

**timeout:** How long to wait for a response (seconds). Increase if you get timeouts on large threads.

**delay:** Adds 2–6 second random waits between requests. Recommended to keep enabled.

**proxies:** Use if you need to route requests through a proxy. Format: `{"https": "http://proxy:8080"}`

Update configuration on an existing scraper:

```python
scraper.set_timeout(45.0)
scraper.set_delay(True)
scraper.set_proxy({"https": "http://proxy.example.com:8080"})
```

## API Reference

### RedditScraper Class

#### scrape(url: str, return_raw: bool = False) -> Thread | dict

Scrape a single Reddit thread or comment.

```python
# Get parsed Thread object (default)
thread = scraper.scrape("https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/")

# Get raw JSON response
raw_json = scraper.scrape("https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/", return_raw=True)
```

**Parameters:**
- `url`: Reddit thread or comment URL
- `return_raw`: If `True`, return raw JSON dict instead of parsed Thread object (default: `False`)

#### scrape_batch(urls: List[str], skip_errors: bool = True) -> List[Thread]

Scrape multiple URLs and return results.

```python
threads = scraper.scrape_batch(urls, skip_errors=True)
```

#### scrape_csv(input_file: str, output_file: Optional[str] = None, url_column: str = "URL", skip_errors: bool = True) -> List[dict]

Scrape URLs from a CSV file and optionally save results.

```python
results = scraper.scrape_csv("urls.csv", output_file="results.csv")
```

### Data Models

```csv
URL
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/def456/
```

### Output Format

Each row represents one comment (post metadata repeats for each comment):

```csv
url,title,subreddit,post_id,author,post_score,num_comments,comment_author,comment_body,comment_score,comment_depth
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/,Why Python is best...,python,abc123,john_coder,2847,156,jane_dev,"Great explanation! Especially liked...",245,0
https://reddit.com/r/python/comments/abc123/,Why Python is best...,python,abc123,john_coder,2847,156,mike_learn,"I disagree with point 2 because...",89,1
```

**Column definitions:**
- `url`: Reddit thread URL
- `title`: Post title
- `subreddit`: Subreddit name
- `post_id`: Reddit post ID
- `author`: Post author username
- `post_score`: Post upvotes/score
- `num_comments`: Total comment count in thread
- `comment_author`: Comment author username
- `comment_body`: Comment text
- `comment_score`: Comment upvotes/score
- `comment_depth`: Nesting depth (0 = top-level, 1+ = replies)

## Rate Limiting & Responsible Use

**Important:** You must comply with Reddit's Terms of Service and rate limits.

Best practices:
- Keep `delay=True` (default). It adds 2–6 second waits to reduce request bursts.
- Don't scrape the same content repeatedly. Cache results.
- Stop immediately if you see 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.
- Don't use this for spam, manipulation, or violating Reddit's policies.

If you get rate-limited:

```python
scraper.set_timeout(90.0)  # Increase timeout
scraper.set_delay(True)     # Ensure delays are on
# Then try again after 10+ minutes
```

## Alternatives

**When to use PRAW instead:**
- You need to access private/restricted subreddits
- You want to interact with Reddit (voting, posting, composing)
- You prefer the official Python wrapper

**When to use this:**
- You have public URLs and want quick, one-off extraction
- You don't want to manage API credentials
- CSV export is your primary output
